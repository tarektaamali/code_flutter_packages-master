# firebase_auth_service

This package includes `FirebaseAuthService`, a wrapper class for the `firebase_auth` APIs.

It covers only a very limited subset of APIs from `firebase_auth`.

NOTE: The author will only maintain this package for his own internal projects. It will **not** be published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) and, while you're free to use it, it's not meant to be a community project.

Breaking changes may be introduced at any time.
